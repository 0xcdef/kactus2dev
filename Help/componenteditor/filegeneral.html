    <h2>File editor</h2>
    <p>
      File editor can be used to edit the details of a single file within a file set.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Name</b> field contains the relative file path from the containing component XML-file to this file.
      The name can be changed in the file set editor.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Description</b> shows a used given description regarding the currently active file.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>File types</b> list specifies the type of the file. File type can be used i.e. when specifying
      build commands for a group of files. A file can have multiple file types.         
    </p>

    <h3>General options</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Logical name</b> specifies e.g. a VHDL library where the VHDL-file will be compiled to.<br />
      <b>Generators can override logical name </b> defines if the logical name can be 
        overridden by another process.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>File is structural RTL</b> indicates if the file contains only a structural
        Register Transfer Level (RTL) description i.e. no behavioral code.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>File is include file </b> indicates if the file is an include file e.g. C-header file.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>File contains external declarations</b> can be used to indicate that the file contains 
       external declarations and is needed by other files in this file set.
    </p>

    <h3>Build command</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Target file</b> specifies a path to the file that is derived from this file when build process is 
      run. A new file path can be entered or an existing file can be searched with "Browse...".
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Build command</b> can be used to define a build <b>command</b> and <b>flags</b> specific to this file.
	  For example, a C-source file could have a build command 'gcc' with flags '-O2'.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flags can either <b>replace default flags</b> (e.g. those specified for this file type) 
      in the build script or be appended to them. The value can be given as an 
      expression, but must evaluate to 1 or 0.
    </p>

    <h3>External dependencies and defines </h3>
    <p>
      <b>Dependencies</b> contains a list of directory paths containing (include) files on which the 
      file depends.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exported names</b> contains a list names defined within the file that can be 
	  referenced externally.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Image types</b> contains a list of the current files relations to executable image types in 
      the design.
