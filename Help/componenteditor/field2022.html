    <h2>Field editor</h2>

    <p>
        The field editor is used to edit the details of a <i>field<i>. For example user may 
        define <i>enumerated values</i> that define the legal bit patterns of the <i>field<i>.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Name</b> is a mandatory identifier for the <i>field</i>. The name must be unique
        within all the <i>fields</i> of the containing <i>register</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Display name</b> is an optional and used for a more user-friendly identifier.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Short description</b> is an optional field for compact description of the <i>field</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Description</b> is an optional field for textual description of the <i>field</i>.
    </p>

    <h3>Field definition</h3>
    <p>
        <b>Offset</b> is mandatory and describes the starting bit of the <i>field</i> within
        the containing <i>register</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Width</b> is mandatory and speficies how many bits are included in the <i>field</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Volatile</b> is optional and indicates that the <i>field</i> may change its value
        without write operations.
    </p>

    
	<h3>Resets</h3>
	<p>
        <i>Resets</i> describe the reset values of the <i>field</i>. Each reset has the following subelements:
		<ul>
            <li><b>Reset type reference</b>. Identifies the defined reset. This should correspond to a
				user-defined reset type element. Default value is HARD, and only one reset can be defined as that.</li>
                <li><b>Reset value</b> is mandatory and defines the actual reset value on reset. Reset value uses
				SystemVerilog syntax for binary values. The number of bits must be equal to the <i>field</i> size.</li>
                <li><b>Reset mask</b> is optional and defines the bits that have a known reset value. Bit
				value of 1 means that the corresponding bit has a known reset value whereas 0 means that
				the value is unknown. Reset mask uses SystemVerilog syntax for binary values e.g. 'b1011,
				4'b1011, and 4'b10_11 are all valid values. The number of bits must be equal to the <i>field</i> size.</li>
            </ul>
	</p>
	
    <h3>Enumerations table</h3>
    <p>
        The enumerated values table enables the defining of bit patterns that can be identified
        by a name. This can be used to define the legal bit patterns for a field or to define
        some default settings to help configuration of the field.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Each enumeration contains a unique <b>name</b> of the enumeration (mandatory), an
        optional <b>display name</b> and <b>description</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Value</b> defines the value to assign to the specified name (mandatory).
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Usage</b> defines the software access condition under which this name value pair
        is valid. Possible values are: <i>read</i>, <i>write</i> and <i>read-write</i>.
    </p>

    <h3>Field access policies table</h3>

    <p>Field access policies define field access properties for different operating modes.</p>

    <p>
        <b>Mode(s)</b> contains references to component modes. It is optional, and defines for which 
        component modes the field access policy is active. If a field access policy contains no mode references, 
        it is active for all component modes and no additional field access policies may be defined.

        A field access policy is active, if it references an active mode and has the highest <i>priority</i>
        (i.e. the lowest priority value) among the field access policies of the field.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Access</b> is optional and specifies the accessability of the <i>field</i> when that field 
        access policy is active. The possible values are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>read-write</b>. Both read and write transactions may have an effect on this <i>
            field</i>. Write transactions may affect the contents of the <i>field</i>, and read
            transactions return a value related to the <i>field</i>.</li>
        <li><b>read-only</b>. A read transaction to this <i>field</i> returns a value related
            to the value in the <i>field</i>. A write transaction to this <i>field</i> has undefined
            results.</li>
        <li><b>write-only</b>. A write transaction to this address affects the contents of the
            <i>field</i>. A read transaction to this <i>field</i> has undefined results.</li>
        <li><b>read-writeOnce</b>. Both read and write transactions may have an effect on this
            <i>field</i>. Only the first write transaction may affect the contents of the <i>field</i>,
            and read transactions return a value related to the values in the <i>field</i>.</li>
        <li><b>writeOnce</b>. Only the first write transaction affects the contents of this
            <i>field</i>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <b>Read action</b> is optional and specifies if some action happens to the <i>field</i>
        after a read operation. By default the <i>field</i> is unmodified. The possible
        values are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>clear</b>. All bits in the <i>field</i> are cleared to '0' after a read operation.</li>
        <li><b>set</b>. All bits in the <i>field</i> are set to '1' after a read operation.</li>
        <li><b>modify</b>. Indicates that the bits of the <i>field</i> are modified in some
            way after a read operation.</li>
        <li><b>'&nbsp; ' (empty setting)</b>. Indicates that the <i>field</i> is not modified
            after a read operation. This is the default.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <b>Read response</b> is optional and describes the expected read value of the field in a 
        certain mode. If not present, then the reset value is expected to be read.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Testable</b> is optional and specifies if the <i>field</i> is testable by an
        automated register test.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Test constraint</b> is optional and specifies the constaints for the automated
        tests for the <i>field</i>. Can be set only when testable is set to true. The possible values are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>unConstrained</b>. There are no constraints for the written or read data. This
            is the default setting.</li>
        <li><b>Restore</b>. The <i>field</i> value must be restored to its original value before
            accessing another register. </li>
        <li><b>WriteAsRead</b>. The data written to a <i>field</i> must be same that was read
            previously from the <i>field</i></li>
        <li><b>ReadOnly</b>. Indicates that the <i>field</i> can only be read.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <b>Reserved</b> is optional and indicates if the field is reserved for other use.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Modified write value</b> is optional and describes how the data in the <i>field</i>
        is manipulated on a write operation. The basic operation without any setting is
        to store the written value 'as is'. Moreover, both bitwise and field-wise set/clear/toggle
        is also possible. The possible values are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>oneToClear</b>. Each written '1' bit will assign the corresponding bit to '0'.</li>
        <li><b>oneToSet</b>. Each written '1' bit will assign the corresponding bit to '1'.</li>
        <li><b>oneToToggle</b>. Each written '1' bit will toggle the corresponding bit.</li>
        <li><b>zeroToClear, zeroToSet, zeroToToggle</b>. Similar to previous ones, except that
            written '0' bit triggers the action.</li>
        <li><b>clear</b>. Each write operation will clear all bits in the <i>field</i> to '0'.</li>
        <li><b>set</b>. Each write operation will set all bits in the <i>field</i> to '1'.</li>
        <li><b>modify</b>. Indicates that after a write operation, all bits in the <i>field</i>
            can be modified.</li>
        <li><b>'&nbsp; ' (empty setting)</b>. Indicates that the value written to a <i>field</i>
            is the value stored in the <i>field</i>. This is the default value.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The <b>write value constraint</b>s are used to define what are the legal values
        user may write to a <i>field</i>. The possible values are:
        <ul>
            <li><b>No constraints</b>. Indicates that there are no constraints to values to be written.</li>
            <li><b>Write as read</b>. Inidcates that only legal values to be written are the same
                that were previously read from the field.</li>
            <li><b>Use enumerated values</b>. Indicates that the defined enumerated values are the
                only legal values that can be written.</li>
            <li><b>Set minimum and maximum limits</b>. Indicates that the minimum and maximum limits
                can be set for the value written to the <i>field</i>.</li>
        </ul>
