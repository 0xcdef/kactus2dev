    <h2>System Design</h2>
    <p>
      This is Kactus2 extension <br><img src="../images/appicon.png"><br>
      A <i>system design</i> describes the software mapping on hardware resources. 
      <i>Software components</i> can be mapped on hardware accelerators and
      CPUs, and connected using <i>COM</i> and <i>API</i> connections.
    </p>
    <p>
        The design area in the center is divided into typed columns to create cleaner
        layouts. New columns can be created using the <b>Add Column</b> button in the 
        toolbar. The column name can edited by double-clicking the column header. 
        The column order can be changed by drag-dropping the columns by the header.
    </p>
    <p>
        New <i>software component instances</i> can be added by by drag-dropping 
        <i>components</i> from the library into the design area. Hardware components
        cannot be added directly, they must be defined in the underlying hardware design.<br />
        Double-clicking the instance opens the design.
        Selecting an item in the design shows more details in the windows on the right.
    </p>

    <h3>Design Configuration Details</h3>
    <p>
        The Design Configuration Details window is always visible in the design. A <i>design configuration</i> 
        contains additional information about an the design. Each design can have multiple configurations. 
        Design configuration defines what are the <b>active views</b> of the component instances in the design.
    </p>

    <h3>HW Mapping Details</h3>
    <p>
        The HW Mapping Details window is always visible in the system design. An <b>HW component reference</b> 
        defines the top level hardware component for which the system design applies. 
        <b>HW component view</b> defines the view containing the hardware design that is used as
        a platform for the system. Changes to the component reference and view must be confirmed by selecting
        <b>Apply</b>. <b>Revert</b> can be used to change back to the previous component configuration.
