    <h2>Ad-hoc Connection</h2>
    <p>
		<b>Ad-hoc connections</b> define the ad-hoc connections for the component instances
		in the design. They are only used to connect individual physical ports
        whereas <i>interconnections</i> connect multiple ports grouped in the <i>bus interfaces</i>.
    </p>
	
    <h3>Connection Editor</h3>
    <p>
        The Connection Editor shows the properties of the selected connection.
    <p>
		A connection has a mandatory <b>name</b> and an optional <b>description</b>.
		By default, the connection is named by the connected instances and ports.
		The name also forms the basis for signal naming in the generated HDL.
    </p>
    <p>
        The connected ports are shown at the bottom. <b>Left Bound</b> and <b>Right Bound</b> can be used
        to select the port bits in the connection. For example, a 2-bit port 'chip_select' could be connected
        to two different instances where the first is connected to the lower bit of 'chip_select'
        (chip_select[0:0]) and the second to the higher bit of 'chip_select' (chip_select[1:1]).
