    <h2>Abstraction Definition</h2>
    <p>
    <p>
        An abstraction definition can also be linked with a bus definition to provide additional validation
        for bus connections. Abstraction definition defines what logical signals must be present in the bus
        interface in order for the bus connection with such abstraction definition to be valid. A logical
        signal can be either a wire signal or a transactional signal.
    </p>

    <p>
        Logical signal editor contains a context menu (right mouse button) that provides following options:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Add initiator signal interface mode</li>
        <li>Add target signal interface mode</li>
        <li>Add system signal interface mode</li>
        <li>Add all unconnected system signals from the bus definition system group</li>
        <li>Reset extended ports to reload the signals that have been extended from the extended abstraction definition </li>
        <li>Add new logical signal (Add row)</li>
        <li>Remove logical signal (Remove row)</li>
        <li>Clear the selected cells</li>
        <li>Copy the contents of the selected cells to clipboard</li>
        <li>Paste the contents of the clipboard to the selected cells</li>
        <li>Import a csv-file to the editor</li>
        <li>Export the contents of the editor to a csv-file</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Extended abstraction definition</h4>
    <p>
        Allows the creation of a family of interconnectable abstraction definitions. The extending abstraction
        definition must have a bus type that extends the bus type of the extended abstraction definition. The
        logical signals of the extended abstraction definition can be used and the following elements can be
        edited:
        <ul>
            <li>Presence</li>
            <li>Width</li>
            <li>Default value</li>
            <li>Driver</li>
            <li>System group</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
