    <h2>View editor</h2>
    <p>
        <i>View</i> specifies a representation level of a component, e.g. there might be different views for 
        simulation and synthesis. This editor is used to edit the details of single view.
    </p>
	<p>
	    <b>Name</b> is a mandatory identifier for the <i>view</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Display name</b> is an optional and used for a more user-friendly identifier.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Short description</b> is an optional field for compact description of the <i>view</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Description</b> is an optional field for textual description of the <i>view</i>.		
    </p>
	
    <h3>Environment identifiers</h3>
    <p>
        Environment identifiers is optional textual information about how this view is deployed in 
        different tool environments.
    </p>
    <p>
		<b>Language</b> indicates this view may be compatible with a particular tool, but only if that 
        language is supported in that tool, e.g., different versions of some simulators may support two or 
        more languages.
    </p>
    <p>
          <b>Tool</b> indicates that this view contains tool-information, e.g., HDL models that use 
          simulator-specific extensions. This should contain tool name and company name, separated by dots
          e.g. 'designcompiler.designcompany.com'. Alternatively, the tool can have a generic value
          such as '*Simulation' or '*Synthesis'.
    </p>
    <p>
          <b>VendorSpecific</b> can further qualify tool and language compatibility, e.g. if some 
          appropriate simulator mode must be enabled. 
    </p>
	
    <h3>Instantiations</h3>
    <p>
        <b>Component instantiation</b> is optional and specifies the <i>component instantiation</i>
		containing all the implementation details for the component with this view. For convenience, 
        details of the component instantiation are shown in the view editor if a <i>component instantiation</i> 
		has been selected. 
		For more information on the  component instantiation, see the component instantiation editor.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Design configuration instantiation</b> is optional and specifies the referenced <i>design configuration 
        instantiation</i>. For convenience, the referenced <i>design configuration</i> is shown in the view 
		editor if a <i>design configuration instantiation</i> has been selected.
		When this view is active, this <i>design configuration</i> should be used to
		configure the component structure. 
		For more information on the design configuration instantiation, see the design configuration 
        instantiation editor.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Design instantiation</b> is optional and specifies the referenced <i>design instantiation</i>. 		
		For convenience, the referenced <i>design</i> is shown in the view 
		editor if a <i>design instantiation</i> has been selected.
		When this view is active, this <i>design</i> should be used to
		describe the component structure. 
		For more information on the design instantiation, see the design instantiation editor.
