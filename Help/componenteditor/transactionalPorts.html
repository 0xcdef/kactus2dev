    <h2>Transactional ports editor</h2>
    <p>
      Transactional ports editor provides a table containing all the <i>transactional ports</i> of a component.
        This editor is used to add, remove and edit the transactional ports.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Port name</b> is a unique identifier and must match the name of the port in the implementation language.
        For example, the ports listed in the VHDL entity declaration are listed here.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Width</b> specifies the data width in bits. Can be given as an expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Initiative</b> defines the type of access. Initiative has four options:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>requires</strong> defines an initiative requirement of the port.</li>
      <li><strong>provides</strong> defines a provider port for initiative.</li>
      <li><strong>both</strong> defines the type of access as both requires and provides.</li>
      <li><strong>phantom</strong> defines a phantom port.</li>
    </ul>
      <p>
          <b>Kind</b> defines the ports type. Kind has four options, in addition to a custom type.
          <ul>
              <li><strong>tlm_port</strong> should only be used for TLM1 notation</li>
              <li><strong>tlm_socket</strong></li>
              <li><strong>simple_socket</strong></li>
              <li><strong>multi_socket</strong></li>
          </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
          <b>Protocol</b> characterizes the information transportation method of the port. Currently not supported
          in Kactus2.
      </p>
    <p>
      The port <b>type</b> is optional together with a <b>type definition</b> that an optional language specific
        reference to where the type is defined, e.g. package or header file. Typical values in VHDL are 'std_logic'
        for scalar ports (i.e. 1 bit) and and 'std_logic_vector' for vectored ports (multibit). In VHDL,
        'std_logic' types are defined in 'IEEE.std_logic_1164.all' ('all' means that the whole package is
        included). In SystemC, the type definition is the include file name, e.g. 'systemc.h'. The type definition
        has no effect if type is not set. The type can be applied to specific view(s) or all views.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Array left</b> and <b>array right</b> are optional and define the indices of an array port. The values
        can be given as an equation, but it must resolve into a decimal number. If either left or right value is
        given, the port is considered to be of an array type.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Port tags</b> column displays the optional tags for a port. These can be used to group ports together 
        to, for example, create bus interfaces.

    </p>
      <p>
          <b>Max connections</b> and <b>Min connections</b> define the number of legal connections that can be made
          to this port. <i>Max connceionts</i> indicates the maximum number of supported connections, while
          <i>Min connections</i> indicates the minimum number of supported connections. These values can be given
          as expressions.
      </p>
    <p>
      <b>Description</b> is an optional free text for further details.
    </p>
    <p>
      Transactional ports editor provides a context menu (right mouse button) that contains following options:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Add new port (Add row)</li>
      <li>Remove port (Remove row)</li>
      <li>Clear the selected cells</li>
      <li>Copy the contents of the selected cells to clipboard</li>
      <li>Paste the contents of the clipboard to the selected cells</li>
      <li>New Bus Interface creates a new bus interface in the component
        using the currently selected ports</li>
      <li>Import a csv-file to the editor</li>
      <li>Export the contents of the editor to a csv-file</li>
    </ul>

      EXAMPLE. The figure shows the relation between VHDL source code and the port editor. The names, directions,
        and bounds are obvious. Width is derived from the bounds, if given, but otherwise set to 1 to denote a
        scalar port. The type of the ports is std_logic for clk and rst_n, and std_logic_vector for data_in and
        data_out. For data_out, the type is defined only for view flat. In other ports no view is defined so the
        same type is applied for all views (not shown in the figure below). The type definition is
        IEEE.std_logic_1164.all for each port.
