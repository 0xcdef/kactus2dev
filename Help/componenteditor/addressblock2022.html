    <h2>Address block editor</h2>
    <p>
        Address block editor is used to edit the details of an address block and the registers
        contained within it.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Name</b> is a mandatory identifier for the <i>address block</i>. The name must
        be unique within all the <i>address blocks</i> of the containing <i>memory map</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Display name</b> is an optional and used for a more user-friendly identifier.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Short description</b> is an optional field for compact description of the <i>address block</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Description</b> is an optional field for textual description of the <i>address block</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Base address</b> is mandatory and specifies the starting address for the <i>address
            block</i> in address unit bits.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Range</b> is mandatory and specifies the size of the block in <i>address units bits</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Width</b> is mandatory and defines the data width of a row in the <i>address block</i>.
        The width value is given in bits.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Usage</b> is a mandatory value to specify the usage of the address block and
        may have one of the following values:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Memory</b> The <i>address block</i> is ROM, RAM or write-only memory as defined
            by <b>access policies</b>. Registers and register files within will be considered virtual.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Register</b> The <i>address block</i> range may contain registers.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Reserved</b> The <i>address block</i> is reserved for other usage and shall not
            contain registers or register files.
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
        <b>Volatile</b> is optional and indicates whether the stored value may change without
        the master's write operation or not.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b>Access policies</b> are optional and specify the accessability of the address block data for different operating modes,
        specified by mode references. If no mode reference is present, then the access policy applies to all modes.
        The possible access values for an access policy are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>read-write</b>. Both read and write transactions may have an effect on this <i>
            address block</i>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>read-only</b>. Only read transactions are allowed in this <i>address block</i>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>write-only</b>. Only write transactions are allowed in this <i>address block</i>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>read-writeOnce</b>. Read actions and the first write action may have an effect
            on this <i>address block</i>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>writeOnce</b>. Only the first write action affects the contents of this <i>address
            block</i>.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Registers table</h3>
    <p>
        The register table enables the user to define <i>registers</i> for the <i>address block</i>,
        with each row representing a single register. Each register must also contain at
        least one bit <i>field</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Name</b> is a mandatory identifier for the <i>register</i>.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Offset</b> is mandatory and specifies the location of the <i>register</i> from
        the start of the containing <i>address block</i> expressed as number of addressing
        units. The actual address of the <i>register</i> is the sum of <i>address block</i>'s
        base address and the <i>register</i> offset. E.g. if the base address is 'h100 and
        the register offset is 'h4, the register's address is 'h104. Offset can be given
        as a SystemVerilog expression.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Size</b> is mandatory and defines the number of data bits the <i>register</i>
        contains. Size must be less than or equal to the width of the containing <i>address block</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Dimension</b> is optional and assigns an array dimension to the <i>register</i>.
        The <i>register</i> will be repeated in the <i>address block</i> as many times as
        indicated by the dimension value. If empty (default) or 1, the register will appear
        exactly once.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Volatile</b> is optional and indicates whether the <i>register</i> value may
        change without a write operation to it, i.e. by an interrupt event, or not.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Access</b> is optional and specifies the accessibility of the <i>register</i> by modifying
        the first access policy of the register. If multiple <i>access policies</i> exist, then the access value 
        cannot be edited here and must be edited for each access policy separately in the register editor. 
        If no access policy exists, then one will be created for the register when the access is edited here.

        The possible access values are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>read-write</b>. Both read and write transactions may have an effect on this <i>
            register</i>.</li>
        <li><b>read-only</b>. Only read transactions are allowed in this <i>register</i>.</li>
        <li><b>write-only</b>. Only write transactions are allowed in this <i>register</i>.</li>
        <li><b>read-writeOnce</b>. Both read and write transactions may have an effect on this
            <i>register</i>. Only the first write transaction, after an event that caused the
            reset value of the <i>register</i> to be loaded, may affet the contents of the <i>register</i>,
            and read transactions return a value related to the values in the <i>register</i>.</li>
        <li><b>writeOnce</b>. Only the first write transaction affects the contents of the <i>
            register</i>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <b>Description</b> is an optional field for textual description of the <i>register</i>.
    </p>

	<h3>Register files table</h3>
    <p>
        The register files table enables the user to define <i>register files</i> for the
		<i>address block</i> where each row represents a single register file.
		Register files are used to group together <i>registers</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Name</b> is a mandatory identifier for the <i>register file</i>.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Offset</b> is mandatory and specifies the location of the <i>register file</i> from
        the start of the containing <i>address block</i> expressed as number of addressing
        units. Offset can be given as a SystemVerilog expression.
    </p>
    <p>
	   <b>Range</b> is mandatory and specifies the size of the <i>register file</i> in address
	   unit bits.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Dimension</b> is optional and assigns an array dimension to the <i>register file</i>.
        The <i>register file</i> will be repeated in the <i>address block</i> as many times as
        indicated by the dimension value. If empty (default) or 1, the register file will appear
        exactly once.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Description</b> is an optional field for textual description of the <i>register file</i>.
