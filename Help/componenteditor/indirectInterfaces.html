    <h2>Indirect interfaces editor</h2>

    <p>
      Indirect interfaces editor contains the summary of the <i>indirect interfaces</i>
      of the component. An <i>indirect interface</i> is used to define access to
      <i>memory maps</i> that are not directly accessible through a <i>bus interface</i>.
      This editor can be used to add and remove indirect interfaces to the containing component. 
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Name</b> is a mandatory identifier for the <i>indirect interface</i>. The name must be unique
        within all the <i>indirect interface</i> of the containing <i>component</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Display name</b> is an optional and used for a more user-friendly identifier.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Indirect address field</b> is mandatory and defines the bit field used for
        addressing in the <i>indirect interface</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Indirect data field</b> is mandatory and defines the bit field used for
        data in read/write operations in the <i>indirect interface</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Memory map</b> defines the indirectly accessible <i>memory map</i> for     
        the <i>indirect interface</i>. If a <i>memory map</i> has been defined,
        <i>transparent bridges</i> must be left empty.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Transparent bridges</b> define the master <i>bus interface(s)</i> that
        all transactions through this <i>indirect interface</i> are directed out of. 
        If <i>transparent bridges</i> have been defined, <i>memory map</i> must be left empty.
        <i>Transparent bridges</i> are shown here, but must be edited in the 
        editor of the respective <i>indirect interface</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Description</b> is an optional field for textual description of the <i>indirect interface</i>.
    </p>

    EXAMPLE 1. The memory map MM0 is accessible through slave bus interface accessIF.
    Indirect interface II0 identifies bitfields data and address in registers r0 and
    r1 which are used to access memory map MM1. The access to memory map
    MM1 occurs at the memory location defined by the content of the address field and
    the content of the field data is either written into register r6 in a write operation
    or read from r6 into field data in a read operation.

    EXAMPLE 2. The memory map MM0 is accessible through slave bus interface accessIF.
    Indirect interface II0 identifies bitfields data and address in registers r0 and
    r1 which are used to access other components through master bus interface outIF.
