    <h2>Ad-hoc Port</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Ad hoc Port Details</b> shows the selected port <b>name</b>, <b>direction</b>
        and bounds as defined in the containing component.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Tied value</b> can be set
        to connect a port to a constant value e.g. 0 for unsed input. The value can be given
        as an expression, but it must resolve into a bit value compatible with the port
        width. Tied value is valid only for in/inout ports of a component instance and out/inout
        ports of the top-level component.
	</p>
    <p>
		Ad-hoc ports can be re-positioned by drag-dropping.
