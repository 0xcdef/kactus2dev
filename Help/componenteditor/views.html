    <p>
      Views editor provides a summary of the views of the
      component. The editor can be used to add and remove views.
      <i>View</i> specifies a representation level of a component,
      e.g. there might be different views for simulation and
      synthesis. Component must have at least 1 view. It can also have
      many views and one of them activated when component is
      instantiated in a <i>design</i>.
