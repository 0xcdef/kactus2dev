    <h2>Bus interfaces editor</h2>
    <p>
      The bus interfaces editor displays a summary of the bus
      interfaces of a component. A <i>bus interface</i> groups
      <i>ports</i> together to form an interface that fulfills
      requirements for a bus protocol. Connecting two matching
      interfaces means connecting multiple ports (up to tens or even
      hundreds of bits) together very easily. This editor is used to
      add and remove bus interfaces in a component
	  <br />

    </p>
    <p>
      Bus interface has a mandatory <b>name</b> and optional textual <b>description</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bus definition</b> and <b>abstraction definition</b> columns display the <i>VLNV</i>-identifiers of the
      IP-XACT documents that define qualities of the interface. These
      fields must be set in the bus interface-specific editor.
    </p>
    <p> 
      <b>Interface mode</b> has 7 different choices (3 modes and 2
      flavors of each, plus 1 extra):
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>1. <b>Master</b> initiates transactions, e.g. a write or read. 
	  A master may have an <i>address space</i> which captures the programmer's view of the system.</dt>
      
      <dt>2. <b>Slave</b> responds to transactions, e.g. accepts the written value or provides the read value.
	  A slave may have a <i>memory map</i> which captures information about the accessible registers inside this component.</dt>
      
      <dt>3. <b>System</b> can be used for some interfaces that do not fit into the master or slave category.</dt>
      
      <dt>4-6. <b>Mirrored master, mirrored slave, mirrored system</b> are the <i>mirrored</i> versions of the
	  above modes.
	  They have the same (or similar) ports as normal interfaces, but the directions of the ports are reversed. 
	  For example, if a <i>master</i> interface has data 
      input, then a <i>mirrored master</i> has data as output.
	  It is not allowed to connect to mirrored interfaces together. 
	  The main usage of mirrored interfaces is at bus interconnects, such as AMBA AHB/APB or HIBI,
	  since they allow constructing a memory map of the whole system, whereas regular IP 
      components mainly utilize direct interfaces.</dt>
      
      <dt>7. <b>Monitor</b> is an interface that can be used for verification process. 
	  It gathers data from other interfaces, i.e. non-intrusive observation and hence all logical port are inputs</dt>
    </dl>

    <p> 
      IP-XACT allows 3 kinds of connections
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Direct master to slave: Point-to-point connection. Complex cases require using bus interconnect
      component containing <i>bridge(s)</i>, such as multillayer AHB bus. </li>
      
      <li>Direct-mirrored: master to mirrored master, mirrored slave to slave, system to mirrored system. 
      Point-to-point connection. Complex cases require using bus interconnect component containing 
      <i>channel(s)</i> </li>
      
      <li>Monitor: any type except monitor to monitor. Many monitors can be connected to single interface</li>
    </ol>
    <hr>
    <p>    
      E.g. IP_0 writes data through its master interfce to
      interconnect's mirrored master interface. On the receiving side,
      interconnect's mirrored slave interface writes the data to
      IP_1's slave interface.
