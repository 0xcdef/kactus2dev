<h2>Step 3: Creating Documents</h2>

<p>A new document is required for new IP as well as for IP lacking IP-XACT packaging.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the new button on the top ribbon.</li>
<li>Select a document type. Detailed descriptions are in their corresponding sections in the manual.
<ul>
    <li>Bus Definition determines constraints for bus connections.</li>
    <li>Catalog groups IP-XACT documents.</li>
    <li>HW Component describes a hardware IP with behavioral functionality.</li>
    <li>HW Design describes an IP that instantiates and connects other hardware IPs.</li>
    <li>SW Component is used to group software source files and set their build rules.</li>
    <li>SW Design describes an IP that instantiates and connects other software IPs.</li>
    <li>System describes an IP that instantiates and connects software IPs and maps them to hardware IPs.</li>
    <li>API definition describes external functions provided by software components.</li>
    <li>COM Definition determines constraints for interprocess connections.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In case of HW component or HW design, you may select hierarchy level and firmness. See more details in the component section of the manual.</li>
<li>Type VLNV tuple for the document:
<ul>
    <li>Vendor identifies the owner. To ensure uniqueness, it should be their internet domain name in left-to-right order (e.g., tut.fi not fi.tut).</li>
    <li>Library is used to group documents, and thus should reflect the type of the IP-XACT document. This field is auto-filled with the selected hierarchy level, but you may replace it with something more accurate.</li>
    <li>The name should be self-explanatory.</li>
    <li>Technically, another version means another document.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Select a directory for the new document. Default location is constructed from the VLNV. It is based on the location of the default library, which was chosen in <a href="configureLibrary.html">step 1.</a></li>
<li>Click ok. If you are creating a component, this will open the component creation wizard. If you are not importing any existing IP, close it by clicking Finish.</li>
</ol>
