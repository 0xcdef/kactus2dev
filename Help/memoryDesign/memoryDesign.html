</head><body>    <h2>Memory Design</h2>    <p>        Memory design displays all the address spaces and memory maps from the associated HW design. These are        constructed from the component instances and their contained components. Connections made between the bus        interfaces in the HW design are displayed here as connections between the address space referenced by the        connected master bus interface and the memory map referenced by the connected slave interface.<br />        Initially the memory design is shown at the most simple level, all the items and connections are condensed        and both the sub memory items and bridge connections are hidden. These can all be expanded and shown        through the buttons on the <i>Filtering Tools</i> group in the tool bar.    </p>    <p>        Address spaces are displayed in green on the left side of the view. The address spaces are constructed        using the address spaces of the instanced components in the associated HW design. The address spaces can        contain address segments.    </p>    <p>        Memory maps are displayed in blue on the right side of the view. The memory maps are constructed using the        memory maps of the instanced components in the associated HW design. The memory maps can contain address        blocks, registers and register fields.    </p>    <p>        The memory items are displayed as rectangular items containing information regarding the memory item.        <ul>            <li><b>Name</b> displays the name of the memory item. If the item has a display name, it is shown                instead of the real name.</li>            <li><b>Instance name</b> displays the name of the component instance containing the memory item.                The instance name is displayed only for the address spaces and memory maps.</li>            <li><b>Base address</b> displays the modified base address of the memory item. Displayed at the                top corner of the item.</li>            <li><b>Last address</b> displays the modified last address of the memory item. Displayed at the                bottom corner of the item.</li>        </ul>        Additional information can be seen in the tool tip of a memory item.    </p>    <p>        Connections are featured as lines between the connected items, with the connection range displayed on        both sides of the connection. Connections and the connected memory items are arrayd so that the ranges of        the memory items and their sub memory items match.    </p>    <p>        Connections are divided into different classes:        <ul>            <li><b>Regular connections.</b> These are regular connections between an address space and a memory                map.</li>            <li><b>Bridge connections.</b> Bridges are displayed as a connection between a master bus interface                and another, bridged master bus interface. These connections are displayed in green, with a                modified connection line.</li>            <li><b>Local memory map connections.</b> Local memory maps are displayed as connections between an                address space and its local memory map. These are displayed in blue, with a modified connection                line.</li>        </ul>    </p>    <p>        Overlapping connections are displayed in red. with the overlapping range areas displayed next to the        connections.    </p>    <p>        All the sub memory items can be enabled or disabled through the use of buttons in the tool bar. This allows        the user to display only the required information. Additionally, field items can be extended to display        their full name. This can be achieved by pressing the button for extending the field items, or by pressing        ALT together with using the mouse wheel.<br />        The bridged connections are initially hidden, but they can be viewed through the use of Address Space        Filter button.<br />        As the memory items are initially displayed as compressed, it is possible to display them in full. This        can be achieved through the Compress Memory Items button.    </p></body></html>
