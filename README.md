Summary
----------------------------------------------------

Kactus2 is a toolset for designing embedded products, especially FPGA-based
MP-SoCs. The aim is easier IP reusabilility and integration for both hardware and
software. The tool is based on IEEE 1685-2014 "IP-XACT" standard.

What you can do with Kactus2
----------------------------------------------------

Packetize IP for reuse and exchange
 * Import your existing IPs as IP-XACT components
 * Create new IP-XACT components and generate their HDL module headers
 * Reuse IP-XACT files from any standard compatible vendor
 * Reuse the IPs in your designs and connect them with wires and busses

Create HW designs with hierarchy
 * Create multilevel hierarchies, where a design has multiple sub-designs
 * Configure component instances in designs, including the sub-designs
 * Use generator plugins to create HDL with wiring and parameterization

Integrate HW and SW
 * Use memory designer to preview memory maps and address spaces in your hierarchy
 * Pack software to IP-XACT components and map them to hardware
 * Generate makefiles that build executables with rules defined in IP-XACT
 
Examples

Community Guidelines 
----------------------------------------------------

Issues should be left at Kactus2 project management site: https://kactus2.cs.tut.fi

Otherwise support is provided via our email: kactus2@cs.tut.fi

When contributing to Kactus2, you should see the wiki at the project management site.
It will guide on essentials like building with Visual Studio and plugin development.
Contributions to Kactus2 core, the IP-XACTmodels library, and the plugins provided by
TUT will not make to a release unless we accept them and you agree to transfer the
copyrights of the changes to TUT.

When creating a plugin, you may keep it closed or open source, and the copyright stays with you.
