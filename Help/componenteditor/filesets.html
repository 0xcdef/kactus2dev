    <h2>File sets editor</h2>
    <p>
      File sets editor contains a summary table regarding each <i>file set</i> within the component. 
      This table can be used to add and remove file sets.
    </p>
	<p>
      <b>Name</b> is a mandatory identifier for the file set.
    </p>
    <p>
	  <b>Group identifiers</b> are optional and can be used to describe the function or purpose of 
	  the file with a single word. <i>Group identifiers</i> can contain multiple identifiers and 
	  the possible words are not limited. However, the editor suggests the following options:
	    <ul>
	      <li>diagnostics</li>
	      <li>documentation</li>
	      <li>projectFiles</li>
	      <li>simulation</li>
	      <li>sourceFiles</li>
	    </ul>
    </p>
	<p>
      <b>Description</b> is optional field for detailed description of the file set.
	</p>
    <p>
      Right clicking an item in the editor provides a context menu that can be used to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Add a new file set to the component (Add row)</li>
      <li>Remove a file set (Remove row)</li>
      <li>Clear the selected cells</li>
      <li>Copy the contents of the selected cells to clipboard</li>
      <li>Paste the contents of the clipboard to the selected cells</li>
      <li>Import a csv-file to the editor</li>
      <li>Export the contents of the editor to a csv-file</li>
    </ul>
	 
    <h3>File Dependencies</h3>

    <p>
      Below the file sets editor is a dependency table to display the dependencies between the 
      files within all the file sets. File dependencies are typically introduced by include 
	  directives (e.g. in C) or instantiation of other modules (e.g. sub-modules in Verilog).
	  Kactus2 uses plugins to automatically analyse dependencies based on the file types.
    </p>
	 <p>
      <b>Status</b> shows if the file has changed since the last dependency analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
	  <b>Path</b> identifies the file.
    </p>
    <p>
	  <b>Filesets</b> shows the fileset(s) containing the file.
    </p>
    <p>
	  <b>#</b> column is used create custom dependencies. The first left-click on the mouse 
	  starts the dependency from the file on the clicked line and the second click ends the 
	  dependency to the file on the line. The first file is now dependent on the second file.
    </p>
    <p>
	  <b>Dependencies</b> show the dependencies for the file. A file dependent on another has a 
	  round end point of the arrow on the line whereas the required file has an arrow head on the 
	  line. Automatically created dependencies are denoted in black and user created dependencies
	  in magenta. A file can have arbitrary number of depenedencies. Clicking on the arrow shows 
	  additional  information about the dependency in the Dependency Information below.
	</p>
	 
	<h3>Dependency Information</h3>
  	<p>
      <b>Description</b> displays the description of the file dependency.
    </p>
    <p>
	  <b>Bidirectional</b> indicates that both of the files are dependent on each other.
    </p>
    <p>
	  <b>Locked</b> can be set to protect the depencendy from being changed without expicitly
	  re-opening the lock.
    </p>
	<p>
	   <b>Reverse Direction</b> changes the dependent and prerequisite file relation to the
	   opposite of the current state.
	</p>

      EXAMPLE. The names of filesets do not need to be same as directories
      (vhdlSource vs. vhd/) but they can be (e.g. syn). <br>
