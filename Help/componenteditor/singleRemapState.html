    <h2>Single remap state editor</h2>
    <p>
      Remap state editor is used to edit the details of a single remap state.
      A <i>remap state</i> defines a conditional state which
      is conditioned by a remap port.
      A <i>remap state</i> element does not specify the remapping addresses. Instead, they
      are defined by the <b>memory remap</b> element (in a <b>memory map</b> element),
	  and its state attribute refers the <b>remap state</b> by name.
    </p>
	<p>
	    <b>Name</b> is a mandatory identifier for the <i>remap state</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Display name</b> is an optional and used for a more user-friendly identifier.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Description</b> is an optional field for textual description of the <i>remap state</i>.		
    </p>
	
	<h3>Remap State Condition</h3>
    <p>
      In addition to the name group, a remap state contains a remap state condition,
      which is specified with the <b>remap port</b> elements. These elements make up the
      condition for this remap state. All elements must be true for the remap state to
      be enabled.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Port</b> contains the names of the selected remap ports. These remap ports are
      selected among the components ports. No port can be selected twice.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Left bound</b> shows the left bound value of the selected port.
      This value cannot be given, as it is read using the selected port. Together with
      the value of the right bound column, this value is used to calculate the width of the port.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Right bound</b> shows the right bound value of the selected port.
      This value cannot be given, as it is read using the selected port. Together with
      the value of the left bound column, this value is used to calculate the width of the port.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Value</b> contains the value necessary so the specified port activates the
      <i>remap state</i>. Depending on the width of the port, the remap condition value may be given as a single
      expression for the whole port, or as separate expressions for each bit of the port. A port with a width of 1
      is only allowed to receive a single expression.
