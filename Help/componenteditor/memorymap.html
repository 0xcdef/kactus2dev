    <h2>Memory map editor</h2>
    <p>
        Memory map editor can be used to edit the details of a <i>memory map</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Memory maps visualization is shown on the right of the editor. The visualization
        can be expandped and minimized by clicking the expand arrow
        <img src="../images/triangle_arrow_right.png" alt="expand">
        and the minimize arrow
        <img src="../images/triangle_arrow_down.png" alt="minimize">. Selecting any part
        of the visualization will open the editor set for that item. The visualization can
        be resized by dragging the border between the editor and the visualization. Holding
        Ctrl-key while scrolling with the mouse wheel increases/decreases the width of the
        items.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Name</b> is a mandatory identifier for the <i>memory map</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Display name</b> is an optional and used for a more user-friendly identifier.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Description</b> is an optional field for textual description of the <i>memory map</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Address unit bits</b> (AUB) defines the number of data bits each address increment
        of the <i>memory map</i> contains, e.g. 8b or 32b. The default setting for a <i>memory map</i>
        is byte addressable (8 bits). E.g. if AUB=8, then 32-bit registers are at addresses
        0x0, 0x4, 0x8... If AUB=32, they are in addresses 0x0, 0x1, 0x2... AUB is the unit
        for base addresses and ranges within the address map.</p><p>

		<p>
        <b>Is present</b> is optional and allows enabling/disabling of a <i>memory map</i>
        presence in a <i>component</i>. Value 1 indicates that the <i>memory map</i>
        is present in the <i>component</i> whereas value 0 marks the memory map to be
        treated as if it does not exist. Is present can be given as a SystemVerilog expression,
        but it must evaluate to 1 or 0.</p>
		<p>

        <b>Remap state</b> identifies the name of the <i>remap state</i> for which the optional
        <i>memory map</i> elements are active. <i>Memory maps</i> are labeled with a default remap
        state, while <i>memory remaps</i> must be given a <i>remap state</i>. For more information
        on the <i>remap states</i>, see the remap states editor.
    </p>
    <p>

        <b>Slave interface binding</b> shows which slave <i>bus interfaces</i> are used to access
        the <i>memory map</i>. The binding can only be set in the bus interface editor, but is
        shown here for convenience.
    </p>

    <h3>Address blocks table</h3>
    <p>
        <b>Address block</b> specifies a single contiguous block, either a set of registers
        or a block of memory. Registers within the <i>address block</i> are further divided
        into bit <i>fields</i>. (IP-XACT allows <i>bank</i> or <i>subspaceMap</i> elements
        within the <i>address block</i>, but they are not yet supported by Kactus2 (v3.3,
        December 2016)).
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Name</b> is a mandatory identifier for the <i>address block</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Base address</b> is mandatory and specifies the starting address for the <i>address block</i>.
        It is expressed as address unit bits as defined in the containing <i>memory map</i>,
		e.g. 8 or 32 bits.</p><p>

        <b>Range</b> is mandatory and specifies the size of the block in address unit bits.
    </p>
    <p>

        <b>Width</b> is mandatory and specifies the data width in bits of a row in the
		<i>address block</i>. It sets the
        maximum allowed size of a single transfer and also defines the maximum size of a
        single register. Register can be smaller but not wider than the value.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Usage</b> is optional and is used to categorize the usage of the <i>address block</i>. The
        possible values are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Memory</b> specifies the <i>address block</i> as memory.
		A memory <i>address block</i> cannot contain registers.</li>
        <li><b>Register</b> specifies the entire <i>address block</i> to contain registers.</li>
        <li><b>Reserved</b> specifies the entire <i>address block</i> as reserved for usage
		that is unknown to IP-XACT. A reserved <i>address block</i> cannot include registers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <b>Access</b> is optional and is used to specify the accessibility of the <i>address block</i>.
		The possible values are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>read-write</b>. Both read and write transactions may have an effect on this address
            block.</li>
        <li><b>read-only</b>. Only read transactions are allowed in this register.</li>
        <li><b>write-only</b>. Only write transactions are allowed in this register.</li>
        <li><b>read-writeOnce</b>. Read actions are allowed and the first write action may have
            an effect on this address block.</li>
        <li><b>writeOnce</b>. Only the first write action affects the contents of this address
            block.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <b>Volatile</b> is optional and indicates that the stored value may change without master's
        write operation. For example, the timer value gets updated automatically and master
        must always issue a read to get the latest value.
    </p>

	<p>
        <b>Is present</b> is optional and allows enabling/disabling of a <i>address block</i>
        presence in a <i>memory map</i>. Value 1 indicates that the <i>address block</i>
        is present in the <i>memory map</i> whereas value 0 marks the memory map to be
        treated as if it does not exist. Is present can be given as a SystemVerilog expression,
        but it must evaluate to 1 or 0.</p>
	<p>

    <p>
        <b>Description</b> is an optional field for textual description of the <i>address block</i>.
    </p>

    <h3>Subspace maps table</h3>

    <p>
    <b>Name</b> is a mandatory identifier for the <i>subspace map</i>.
  </p>
  <p>
      <b>Base address</b> is mandatory and specifies the starting address for the <i>subspace
          map</i> in address unit bits. The range is equal to the referenced <i>address
          space</i> or <i>segment</i>.
  </p>
    <p>
        <b>Master interface</b> is a mandatory identifier for the bridged master <i>bus interface</i>
        that is accessed by the subspace map.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Segment</b> is an optional reference to a <i>segment</i> within the
          referenced master <i>bus interface</i>. If a <i>segment</i> is defined,
          the access is limited to the specified segment instead of the whole
          <i>address space</i>.
    </p>
  <p>
        <b>Is present</b> is optional and allows enabling/disabling of a <i>subspace map</i>
        presence in a <i>memory map</i>. Value 1 indicates that the <i>subspace map</i>
        is present in the <i>memory map</i> whereas value 0 marks the subspace map to be
        treated as if it does not exist. Is present can be given as a SystemVerilog expression,
        but it must evaluate to 1 or 0.
      </p>

        EXAMPLE 1. A simple IP could have 1 memory map, 1 address block inside it, and three
        32-bit registers: ctrl, data_in, and data_out. Ctrl allows both read and write accesses,
        data_in is write-only, and data_out is read-only. The lower part of ctrl register
        is divided into two 8-bit fields and designer can describe how they are used. The
        upper bits are not used. Data registers do not have field definitions.
        <br>
        <br>
        Number of Addresss unit bits(AUB) of the memory map is set to 8 bits. There are
        3 registers with identical size (32b), Hence, range = 12 = 3 * 32/AUB = 3 * 32/8
        = 3 * 4. Let's assume base address=0x100. Since address block has 12 Bytes in total,
        it reserves the (byte) addresses 0x100-0x10B. It is good to set the width of the
        address block 32 b so that full register can be accessed at once. Smaller accesses
        (e.g. 1 byte at a time) are also allowed.

        EXAMPLE 2. An opaque bridge provides access from a slave interface
        to a master interface through a specific memory region i.e. a subspace map.
        The address space and any memory maps connected to the master interface
        remain obscured (opaque) behind the subspace map.
        <br>
        <br>
        The slave bus interface accessIF provides access to memory map MM0 which contains
        an address block ab0 and a subspace map ssm0. The subspace map refers master bus
        interface outIF indicating that any access to memory locations within ssm0 are redirected
        out of bus interface outIF. The subspace map size will match the address space AS0 range
        (or segment range, if segment is specified) referenced in master interface outIF.
        Any interface connected to accessIF will have visibility only to ab0 and ssm0 within the
        memory map MM0 and no visibility to AS0 while still being able to transfer data to
        components connected to outIF.
