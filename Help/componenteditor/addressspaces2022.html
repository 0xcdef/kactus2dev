    <h2>Address spaces editor</h2>
    <p>
      Address spaces editor contains the summary of the address spaces
      of the component. This editor can be used to add and remove
      address spaces to the containing component. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Address space</b> defines the addressable memory space that can be accessed through
	  a master <i>bus interface</i>. It is the programmer's view to the rest of the system.
      <br />Note: Address spaces are actually instance-specific concepts (what other units are 
      there and what are their addresses) rather than component-specific. Nevertheless, IP-XACT standard 
      defines address space inside a component, although it is seldom a reusable element.
    </p>
	<p>
	    <b>Name</b> is a mandatory identifier for the <i>address space</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Addressable unit bits</b> specifies the number of bits each address increment contains, 
      e.g. 8 bits or 32 bits. The AUB is mandatory if the address space contains a <i>local memory map</i>. 
	  AUB is 8 by default.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Range</b> is mandatory and defines the size of the address space in addressable units. In other 
      words, it is the number of separate addresses in the address space.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Width</b> is mandatory and defines the data width of a row in bits thus
	  defining the maximum size for a single transfer.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Initiator interface binding</b> shows the initiator <i>bus interfaces</i> bound to the address space. 
	    The binding can be set in the bus interface editor.
    </p>
	
	  <p>
      <b>Description</b> is an optional field for textual description of the <i>address space</i>.		
    </p>
    <p>
      Address spaces editor contains a context menu (right mouse button) providing following options:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Add new address space (Add row)</li>
      <li>Remove address space (Remove row)</li>
      <li>Clear the selected cells</li>
      <li>Copy the contents of the selected cells to clipboard</li>
      <li>Paste the contents of the clipboard to the selected cells</li>
      <li>Import a csv-file to the editor</li>
      <li>Export the contents of the editor to a csv-file</li>
    </ul>
	<hr>
	<p>
		EXAMPLE. The address space AS0 defines the available address space of the whole system
		when accessed through bus interface MainIF. This is what the component CPU0 requires
		of the system, but the components connected to MainIF may be different.
